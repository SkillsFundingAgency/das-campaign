<p class="govuk-body">The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non accessible content</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Some of the text on the website does not meet the minimum colour contrast requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast minimum). We plan to fix these issues by the end of 2019 and will ensure all future design changes meet the requirements.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Some of the headings on the homepage do not accurately describe the purpose of the page. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels). This will be addressed by the end of 2019, and more consideration will be given to the purpose of headings for future content changes.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Page headings become unreadable when text spacing is overridden. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.12 (text spacing). We plan to fix this by the end of the year.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This website was last tested on 8 July 2019. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC).</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The DAC user and technical team carried out an accessibility audit of the entire Fire it up website (available at apprenticeships.gov.uk). They assessed it against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.1. We are currently working through the issues identified by the DAC to improve the overall accessibility of the website.</p>
