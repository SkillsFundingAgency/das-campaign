<h2>WHICH APPRENTICESHIP IS RIGHT FOR MY ORGANISATION?</h2>

<h2>TYPES OF APPRENTICESHIPS</h2>
<p>Apprentices must work towards an approved apprenticeship. Their training must last at least 1 year.</p><h3>APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS</h3><p>Designed by groups of employers, apprenticeship standards set out the knowledge, skills and behaviours the apprentice needs to be competent in a particular occupation. <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/" title="">Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education</a> is responsible for the development and approval of standards and works with employers to ensure a wide range of high-quality apprenticeship standards are available.</p><h3>APPRENTICESHIP FRAMEWORKS</h3><p>Apprenticeship frameworks are a series of work-related qualifications. There is no end-point assessment for this type of apprenticeship.</p><p>All apprenticeship frameworks will be withdrawn by 2020. This will be a phased approach as employers take on more apprentices using the new apprenticeship standards.</p>
