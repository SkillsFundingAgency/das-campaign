<h2>ASSESSING YOUR APPRENTICE</h2>
<p>Apprenticeship standards are developed by groups of employers, known as ‘trailblazers’, to make sure they’re occupation-focused. Each standard sets out key knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) that employers have identified they need.</p><p>Your apprentice will be assessed to demonstrate what they’ve learnt, and that they can perform all aspects of the occupation. This ‘end-point assessment’ is conducted by an organisation that is independent from the training provider. They’ll make sure all apprentices following the same standard are assessed consistently.</p><p>Each standard includes an end-point assessment plan, which describes how the apprentice should be tested against appropriate criteria, using suitable methods. For example, your apprentice may need to complete:</p><ul><li><p>a practical assessment</p></li><li><p>an interview</p></li><li><p>a project</p></li><li><p>written and/or multiple-choice tests</p></li><li><p>a presentation</p></li></ul><p></p>
<h2>FINDING AN END-POINT ASSESSMENT ORGANISATION</h2>
<p>Only organisations on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations" title="">register of end-point assessment organisations</a> are eligible to conduct the assessment. You must select an organisation from the register and agree a price for them to carry it out.</p><p>Although the training provider will be involved in arranging the end-point assessment, the assessment itself must be independent. The training provider must work with the end-point assessment organisation on your behalf and have a written agreement in place to pay them for conducting the assessment.</p><p>It’s worth getting in touch with the end-point assessment organisation early on in the apprenticeship to check what the assessment involves. This will give your apprentice plenty of time to prepare - for example, they may need to gather evidence to show how they’ve been working towards the core knowledge, skills and behaviours.</p>
<h2>THE COST OF AN END-POINT ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>The cost of the end-point assessment is included in the overall price agreed with the training provider for the apprenticeship. This cost will not usually exceed 20% of the funding band maximum. Check our <a href="/employer/funding-an-apprenticeship" title="">funding guidance</a> to learn about apprenticeship costs and government funding.</p>
<h2>CERTIFICATION</h2>
<p>When your apprentice successfully completes their apprenticeship, they’ll be awarded a certificate. The end-point assessment organisation will request this certificate on your behalf.</p>
