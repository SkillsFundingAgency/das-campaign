        <h2>Using your apprenticeship levy</h2>
<p>As an employer with a pay bill of more than £3 million, you’re required to pay the apprenticeship levy. You can manage funds using the apprenticeship service and spend it on training and assessing your apprentices.</p><p>The government will apply a 10% top up to the funds you have in your account.</p><p>If you don’t have enough funds, you just pay 5% of the outstanding balance and the government will pay the rest. This is up to the funding band maximum allocated to each specific apprenticeship.</p><p>For apprentices that started before 1 April 2019, you need to contribute 10%.</p><p>If you exceed the funding band maximum, you’ll need to pay all the additional costs.</p><p>If you don’t already have an account, find out <a href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/create-apprenticeship-service-account" title="" rel="external" target="_blank">how to set up an apprenticeship service account as an employer</a>.</p>        <h2>Incentive payments for hiring a new apprentice</h2>
<p>To help businesses offer new apprenticeships,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice" title="" rel="external" target="_blank">we have increased incentive payments for employers hiring a new apprentice from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021.</a></p><p>Employers will receive £3,000 for new apprentices of any age who join their organisation from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021. </p><p>You can apply for incentive payments for these apprentices from 1 June 2021 to 30 November 2021.</p><p>The incentive payment is in addition to the £1,000 employers already receive for hiring an apprentice:</p><ul><li><p>aged 16 to 18 years old</p></li><li><p>under 25 with an education, health and care plan or who has been in the care of their local authority</p></li></ul><p></p>        <h2>Hire an apprentice who has been made redundant</h2>
<p>You can also use a new government service to&nbsp;<a href="https://apprentice-support.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/employer" title="" rel="external" target="_blank">help you hire apprentices who have been made redundant</a>.</p><p>Many of these apprentices may already have the skills and knowledge you need. Hiring a new apprentice in this way could mean you have a work-ready apprentice who can quickly add value to your business, shortening the time you’ll see a return on your investment.</p><p>It also means you are supporting an apprentice to complete their training and achieve their apprenticeship.</p><p>If you hire an apprentice that has been made redundant, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice" title="" rel="external" target="_blank">apply for incentive payments for hiring a new apprentice</a>.</p>        <h2>Paying your apprentice</h2>
<p>You’re responsible for paying your apprentice for their normal working hours and any training they do as part of the apprenticeship.</p><p>You must pay them at least the National Minimum Wage rate depending on their age and the year of apprenticeship training they’re in.</p><p>The rates from April 2020 are:</p><table class="fiu-table"><thead><tr><th>Apprentice</th><th>Under 19</th><th>19 to 20</th><th>21 to 24</th><th>25 and over</th></tr><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>In 1st year</td><td>£4.15</td><td>£4.15</td><td>£4.15</td><td>£4.15</td></tr><tr><td>Have completed 1st year</td><td>£4.15</td><td>£6.45</td><td>£8.20</td><td>£8.72</td></tr></tbody></table>        <h2>Transfer funds to another employer</h2>
<p>If you have unused apprenticeship funds, you can transfer them to another employer using the apprenticeship service. This will support them to pay for apprenticeship training and assessment.</p><p>You can find employers who want to receive a transfer by:</p><ul><li><p>working with employers in your supply chain</p></li><li><p>getting in touch with employers in your industry</p></li><li><p>contacting an Apprenticeship Training Agency (ATA)</p></li><li><p>working with regional partners</p></li></ul><p>You can transfer a maximum of 25% of your levy funds.</p>
