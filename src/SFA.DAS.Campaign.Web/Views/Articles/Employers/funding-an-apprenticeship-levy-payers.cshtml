<h1 class="heading-l">Using your apprenticeship levy</h1>
<p>As an employer with a pay bill of more than £3 million, you’re required to pay the apprenticeship levy. You can manage funds using the apprenticeship service and spend it on training and assessing your apprentices. </p>
<p>The government will apply a 10% top up to the funds you have in your account. </p>
<p>If you don’t have enough funds, you just pay 5% of the outstanding balance and the government will pay the rest. This is up to the funding band maximum allocated to each specific apprenticeship.</p>
<p>For apprentices that started before 1 April 2019, you need to contribute 10%.</p>
<p>If you exceed the funding band maximum, you’ll need to pay all the additional costs.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have an account, find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds" target="_blank" rel="external">how to register and use the apprenticeship service as an employer<span class="visually-hidden"> (Opens in a new window)</span></a>.</p>

<h1 class="heading-l">Find apprenticeship training</h1>
<p>Apprenticeships vary by duration, level and type of occupation. </p>

<h1 class="heading-l">INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR HIRING A NEW APPRENTICE</h1>
<p>To help businesses offer new apprenticeships, <a href="https://engage.apprenticeships.gov.uk/incentives.html" target="_blank" rel="external">employers will be able to claim an incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice between 1 August 2020 and 31 January 2021<span class="visually-hidden"> (Opens in a new window)</span></a>.</p>
<p>For every apprentice that is a new employee to your business, you will get up to £2,000 if they are aged 16 to 24 and up to £1,500 if they are 25 or over.</p>
<p>The incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice is designed to support employers to find the skills they need to help recover from the economic impact of Covid-19 whilst creating new jobs.</p>
<p>Employers can also receive an additional payment of £1,000 if the apprentice starts the apprenticeship aged:</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>16 to 18</li>
    <li>19 to 24 years old and has an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan provided by their local authority or has been in the care of their local authority</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-m">HIRE AN APPRENTICE WHO HAS BEEN MADE REDUNDANT</h2>
<p>You can also use a new government service to <a href="https://engage.apprenticeships.gov.uk/redundancy-employer" target="_blank" rel="external">help you hire apprentices who have been made redundant<span class="visually-hidden"> (Opens in a new window)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Many of these apprentices may already have the skills and knowledge you need. Hiring a new apprentice in this way could mean you have a work-ready apprentice who can quickly add value to your business, shortening the time you’ll see a return on your investment.</p>
<p>It also means you are supporting an apprentice to complete their training and achieve their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>If you hire an apprentice that has been made redundant, you can <a href="https://help.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015391139-Incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice-" target="_blank" rel="external">apply for incentive payments for hiring a new apprentice<span class="visually-hidden"> (Opens in a new window)</span></a>.</p>

<h1 class="heading-l">PAYING YOUR APPRENTICE</h1>
<p>You’re responsible for paying your apprentice for their normal working hours and any training they do as part of the apprenticeship.</p>
<p>You must pay them at least the National Minimum Wage rate depending on their age and the year of apprenticeship training they’re in. </p>
<p>The rates from April 2020 are:</p>
