<h2 class="heading-m">How to write your best cv and cover letter</h2>

<p>
    To apply for any apprenticeship, you’ll need to write a CV and covering letter.
</p><p>
    Remember to try and keep your CV simple, and to the point.
</p><p>
    Once you’ve created a basic CV, you can then fine-tune it for each different apprenticeship you apply for.
</p><p>
    Choose the relevant skills, abilities, qualifications and experience that you think best matches the sort of things the apprenticeship requires. 
 <p>  
    Don’t worry if your CV is shorter than 2 pages - you probably won’t have much experience (yet).
