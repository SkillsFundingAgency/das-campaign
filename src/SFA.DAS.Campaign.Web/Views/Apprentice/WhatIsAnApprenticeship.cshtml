<p>
    It’s a real job, with hands-on experience, a salary 
    and the chance to train while you work. You get the same as 
    other employees – a contract of employment, holiday leave, 
    even sick pay.
</p><p>
    If you’re 16 or over, you can become an apprentice as long as 
    you spend at least 50% of your working hours in England - for the duration of the 
    apprenticeship and you are not in full-time education.

    When you're an apprentice:
</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-apprentice">
    <li>
        you get paid and train at the same time, with at least 
        20% of your time spent training, usually at a college, 
        university or with a training provider
    </li>
    <li>
        you study to gain a qualification, which start from level 
        2 (equivalent to GCSE) up to and including degree level

    </li>
    <li>
        you’re on a career path - with lots of future potential for you
    </li>

</ul>



<p>
    Your apprenticeship can take between one and six years to complete, depending on which one, 
    and which level, you choose.
</p><p>
    Different apprenticeships are available all over England, at 
    companies large and small, in a wide range of industries and 
    organisations. From local businesses to large national brands.
</p><p>
    You get valuable hands on work experience whilst you learn, which helps you progress in your working life. 
   
</p><p>
    Completing your apprenticeship means you've earned and learned. Given your training is 
    funded by contributions from the government and your employer, and you receive a regular salary,
    apprenticeships are an great option for getting on the job ladder or supercharging your career.


</p>
<h2 class="heading-m">What are the different types of apprenticeships?</h2>

<p>
    There are hundreds of different apprenticeships to choose from. 
    Whether you’re at the start of your career, want to change career 
    direction, or if you’re returning to work after a break. 


<p>All apprenticeships – no matter what their level – make sure you're ‘job ready’ for the role you have trained for. 
    You can also progress from one level to another, increasing your professional level in the same way you gain 
    experience and promotions in the world of work.</p>
<p>
    Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education, with costs paid for by your employer and the government.
    Apprentices earn a salary right from day one of their employment and training.
