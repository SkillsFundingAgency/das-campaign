<p>
    It’s a real job, with hands-on experience, a salary 
    and the chance to train while you work. You get the same as 
    other employees – a contract of employment, holiday leave, 
    even sick pay.
</p><p>
    If you’re 16 or over, you can become an apprentice as long as 
    you spend at least 50% of your working hours in England - for the duration of the apprenticeship.

        20% of your time spent training, usually at a college, 
        university or with a training provider
    </li>
    <li>
        you study to gain a qualification, which start from level 
        2 (equivalent to GCSE) up to and including degree level

        you’re on a career path - with lots of future potential for you

    Your apprenticeship usually takes between one and six years to complete, depending on which one, 
    and which level, you choose.
</p><p>
    Different apprenticeships are available all over England, at 
    companies large and small, in a wide range of industries and 
    organisations. From local businesses to large national brands.
</p><p>
    You get invaluable hands on work experience whilst you learn, which will help you when you apply for a job. 
    <!--Degree apprenticeships are now recognised as genuine, 
    credible alternatives to full-time university courses.-->
</p><p>
    Completing your apprenticeship means you've earned and learned. Given your training is 
    funded by contributions from the government and your employer, and you receive a regular salary,
    it's easy to see why apprenticeships are now an attractive option.

    Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education, with costs paid for by your employer and the government.
    Apprentices earn a salary right from day one of their employment and training.
</p>
<p>
    Your costs of training and assessment are covered and paid in full, so you have the potential
    to finish without having to pay off any of these costs.
