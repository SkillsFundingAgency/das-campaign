<h2 class="heading-m">What to bring, and other useful info</h2>
<p>
    Your employer will be in touch, to let you know your working hours, 
    and when they’d like you to start on your first day. 
   
</p>

<p>
    At this point you could also ask some of the following:
</p>
    <ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-apprentice">
        <li>
            what you will need to bring - notebook/pens/ID
        </li>
        <li>
            what time you need to arrive
        </li>
        <li>
            how your should dress - suit or jeans
        </li>
        <li>
            how much money you will need to bring for lunch etc
        </li>
        <li>
            who you should ask for when you arrive
        </li>
        <li>
            where to get the bus/train or park your car
        </li>
    </ul>  



<h2 class="heading-m">Meet your new team</h2>

<p>
    When you start your apprenticeship, you’ll meet the people you'll be working with. They will show 
    you around and answer any questions you might have. 

</p>

<h2 class="heading-m">First an apprenticeship, now a career!</h2>
<p>
    Once your apprenticeship is up and running, it’s always worth discussing your future career 
    with your current employer, as well as doing some research yourself.
</p>
<p>
    The sooner you start to take control of the new trail you’re blazing, the better the ride will be.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-m">Get Assessed</h2>
<p>
    When you’re reaching the end of your apprenticeship, you’ll 
    be given the chance to show what you’ve learned as part of a 
    final assessment.  Not all apprenticeships have an assessment, but 
    you will be expected to demonstrate your new skills at some point.
</p>
<p>
    This is a chance for you to show your employer how well you’ve progressed, 
    by showcasing your new skills, knowledge and behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    Your employer and training provider should give you 
    plenty of guidance as to what’s expected, and when your assessment 
    will happen. <!--Alongside your college training and exams, 
    this final assessment will count towards your end qualification. -->
</p>


<h2 class="heading-m">Complete your apprenticeship</h2>
<p>
    Pass the assessment, finish your apprenticeship, 
    enjoy the moment (then jump around, scream, shout, post something on social media). 
    You’ve done it, you did it, you’ve earned this!
</p>
<p>
    So where next?
</p>
<p>
    Just like your apprenticeship, the answer’s up to you. You’ve 
    got a whole new set of skills, an apprenticeship that’ll impress 
    employers, and really useful experiences that 
    show that you can make the step up from apprentice to, well, wherever you want to go.</p>
