    Calling all small and medium sized employers
</h2>
<p class="lead-paragraph">If you're planning to take on apprentices later this year, we'd love to get you on board to pilot the apprenticeship service.</p>
<p>It's your chance to get a sneak preview of what you'll be able to do when it launches in early 2020.</p>
<p>Features include being able to:</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>get funding from the government for training your apprentices</li>
    <li>select and save suitable apprenticeships and end-point assessment organisations</li>
    <li>choose training providers</li>
    <li>create and upload apprenticeship job adverts</li>
    <li>manage job applications</li>
    <li>add apprentices</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is open to employers who:</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>don't pay the apprenticeship levy</li>
    <li>intend to start an apprenticeship between August and October 2019</li>
    <li>are already be working with a provider</li>
    <li>having funding for training in place</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally you'd also have an apprentice (or apprentices) lined up to start their apprenticeship.</p>
<h2 class="heading-m">Hands-on support</h2>
<p>We'll be there for you throughout the process and will encourage feedback, good and bad! That way we'll know everything is running smoothly before we go live.</p>
<p>We only have a limited number of places available, so register your interest now. You can also ask you provider to apply on your behalf.</p>
