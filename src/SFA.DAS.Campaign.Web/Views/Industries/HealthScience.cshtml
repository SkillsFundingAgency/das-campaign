    Health is something we often take for granted, but couldn’t cope without.

                        I've always known that a career within the science field was for me. During my last year of A-levels I started looking for science-based degree apprenticeships and found companies like GSK.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alongside applying for apprenticeships, I also applied to study biological science at university. I was successful with my application to GSK's laboratory apprenticeship scheme. I also had 5 university offers.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking the apprenticeship route was a no-brainer for me as it would provide me with hands-on experience, a fully funded degree in my chosen field of bioscience and a competitive salary working for GSK.
