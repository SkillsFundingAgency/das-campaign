    Attending career fairs and seeking mentors in the industries I was interested in provided the best possible insight, as they could describe what a typical working day looked like. I found that the Transport for London HR apprenticeship provided me with endless opportunities to grow as a professional, which motivated me to apply.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Work that makes a difference</h3>
<p>
    The biggest factor in my decision to do an apprenticeship? Impact! It provided me with a platform to do work that made a difference, regardless of my age or years of experience. I take the work I do very seriously, and it's essential that I'm improving on how things were done in the past.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Develop skills and climb the career ladder</h3>
<p>
    The benefit my apprenticeship has had, and will have, is difficult to put into words. It gave me the qualification I needed to climb the career ladder, and a breadth of experience I couldn't have imagined achieving in 2 years. Friends and family have seen me transform – not only as a professional, but into a confident and passionate individual who truly loves the work I do.
