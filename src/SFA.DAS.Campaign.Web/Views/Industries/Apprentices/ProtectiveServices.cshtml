    It also includes HM Armed Services. The UK Armed Forces are one of the biggest providers of apprenticeships in the country, training apprentices in a large range of different roles and professions. Members of the Armed Forces can learn engineering on a aircraft carrier, qualify in logistics while sending humanitarian aid to disaster-stricken nations, or become a communications specialist monitoring cyber space.

                        I had applied for another brigade prior to obtaining my position in Staffordshire, so I had spoken to local firefighters and taken part in several have-a-go days for different brigades. I had been very disappointed on not getting through the process before, so I was very keen to find another one.

                    <h4 class="heading-s">Choose from hundreds of apprenticeships</h4>
                    <p>
                        I came across Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service online. It was an apprenticeship and would still guarantee full-time service after the training, which was refreshing and something I became very interested in. I researched the brigade and was very keen to adopt the morals they stand by.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-s">Develop skills for the future</h4>
                    <p>
                        The thing I enjoy most about the apprenticeship is the variety of work every day. With regular assessments and development days, my apprenticeship will give me the best stepping-stone to become a highly trained firefighter.
