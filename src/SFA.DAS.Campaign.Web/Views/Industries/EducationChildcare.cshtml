    Working with children and young people is an increasingly popular area for apprentices.
</p>
<p>
    Learning support staff, such as apprentice teaching assistants, play a vital role in today’s classrooms by supporting pupils, parents and colleagues to make sure pupils get the most out of education. Apprenticeships can also involve particular specialisms in areas like music or working with pupils with special educational needs or challenging behaviour, helping them to overcome barriers to learning.
