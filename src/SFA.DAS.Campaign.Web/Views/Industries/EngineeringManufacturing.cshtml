    Almost every object has been manufactured in some way, whether in a factory by huge machines or with hand tools in a small workshop. Manufacturing deals with producing things on an industrial scale, which in turn keeps all the other industries supplied with the materials needed to do their job.

    Engineering, meanwhile, is all about making these things work and includes everything from servicing escalators to checking RAF aircraft to activating phone lines.
