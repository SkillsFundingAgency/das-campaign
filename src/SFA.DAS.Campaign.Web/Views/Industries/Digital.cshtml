                    <p>I started by looking into what types of apprenticeships were on offer. I wanted to develop my learning, so I really liked the idea of a degree apprenticeship. I then came across BT's degree apprenticeships.</p>
                    <p>My favourite subject at sixth form was information and communications technology, so I knew I wanted to work within this field. I began to look into the TV and digital media apprenticeship.</p>
                    <p>I learnt that I would get a degree as well as rotating around various teams within the organisation. That's when I decided that this was the right apprenticeship for me.</p>
