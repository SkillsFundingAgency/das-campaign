<h2 class="heading-m">Which apprenticeship is right for my business?</h2>

<p>
    Apprentices will spend at least 20% of their time on off-the-job
    training with your chosen training provider.  Apprenticeships offer the opportunity to have a flexible, 
    but structured training programme, that meet your business needs.

</p>

<p>
    If you’re an employer who wants to take on an apprentice, you need to know:
</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>apprentices are aged 16 or over (to any age)</li>
    <li>they combine working with studying to gain skills and knowledge in a specific job</li>
    <li>they can be new or current employees who are looking to upskill</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Apprenticeships are being developed, approved and added all the time.
    Keep a lookout for new apprenticeships that have been added and make sure that you
    <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external" id="link-fat"> find the right apprenticeship </a> to
    meet your business needs.
</p>


<p>
    When you're looking for an apprenticeship, make sure you:
</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>select the right training for your business which delivers what you need</li>
    <li>don’t accept training because it’s the only apprenticeship available</li>
    <li>
        are in contact with the training provider and are both involved with the training and
        development of the apprentice
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-m">I want to find an apprentice for my business</h2>

<p>
    If you’re interested in taking on an apprentice you should know:
</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>how much it’s going to cost you</li>
    <li>what funding you can get</li>
    <li>how to find an apprenticeship that suits your business needs</li>
    <li>how to find a training provider who can deliver the right training</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You need to pay the apprentice a salary that doesn’t go below the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" target="_blank" rel="external">minimum wage</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Your apprentice should:
</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>work with experienced staff</li>
    <li>learn job-specific skills</li>
    <li>study whilst doing their apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<a id="types-of-apprenticeships"></a>
<h2 class="heading-m">Types of apprenticeships</h2>
<p>
    Apprentices must work towards an approved apprenticeship.  Their training must last at least 12 months.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-s">Apprenticeship standards</h3>
<p>
    Apprenticeship standards describe the knowledge, skills and behaviours that bring full competence in a particular
    occupation.  They describe how an apprentice can demonstrate mastery of this occupation by the end of the
    apprenticeship.
</p>
<p>
    You should agree with the end-point assessment organisation the cost of the end-point assessment.
    Your training provider will contract with your chosen end-point assessment organisation
    and pay them on your behalf.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-s">Apprenticeship frameworks</h3>

<p>
    Apprenticeship frameworks are a series of work-related qualifications.
    There is no end-point assessment for this type of apprenticeship.
</p>

<p>
    All apprenticeship frameworks will be withdrawn by 2020. This will be a phased approach as
    employers take on more apprentices using the new apprenticeship standards.
