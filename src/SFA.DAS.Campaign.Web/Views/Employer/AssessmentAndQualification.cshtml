<h2 class="heading-m">Assessment</h2>
<p>
    Once the apprenticeship training is completed, an independent assessment will take place, this is called an 'end-point assessment'.  It gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate what they've learnt throughout the apprenticeship. (This assessment only applies for apprenticeship standards and not for frameworks).
</p>
<p>This should include the apprentice's: </p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
    <li>knowledge</li>
    <li>skills</li>
    <li>behaviours</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your apprentice can't achieve an apprenticeship standard without satisfying all the requirements of the assessment plan, including the end-point assessment.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-m">
    Where to find an end-point assessment organisation
</h2>
<p>You must select an organisation to deliver the end-point assessment from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-the-register-of-apprentice-assessment-organisations" target="_blank">register of end-point assessment organisations</a> and agree to a price with this organisation for the end-point assessment.</p>
<p>
    Although the training provider will be involved in arrangements for the end-point assessment, 
    the assessment itself must be independent.
</p>
<p>
    The training provider must contract with the end-point assessment 
    organisation on your behalf and have a written agreement in place to make payment to them for conducting the end-point assessment.
</p>
<h3 class="heading-s">End-point assessment cost</h3>
<p>We expect that the cost of the end-point assessment should not usually exceed 20% of the funding band maximum.</p>
<p>This cost is included in the overall cost agreed with the training provider for the apprenticeship.</p>
<h2 class="heading-m">
    Qualification
</h2>
<p>
    When your apprentice successfully completes their apprenticeship they will be awarded a certificate.
</p>
<p>
    The end-point assessment organisation will request the certificate on your behalf.
