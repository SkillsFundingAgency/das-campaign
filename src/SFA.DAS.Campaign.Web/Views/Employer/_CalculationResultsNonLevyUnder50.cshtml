        However, you may not need to contribute any money towards your training costs if you hire an apprentice who is:

        <ul class="govuk-body">
            <li>
                Aged between 16 and 18 years old; or

    <p class="govuk-body">
        You do not need to pay Class 1 National insurance contributions for apprentices under 25, if the apprentice is on an approved apprenticeship standard.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Just so you know, you're also responsible for paying your aprentice for their normal working hours. You must pay them at least the National Minimum Wage rate depending on their age and the year of apprenticeship training they're in.
