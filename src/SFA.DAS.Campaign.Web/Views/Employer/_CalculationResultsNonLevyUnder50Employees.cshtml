    <p class="govuk-body">
        You may qualify to receive an extra <b>£1,000</b> towards the additional cost associated with training if, at the beginning of the apprenticeship, the apprentice falls into one of the following categories:
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>aged between 16 and 18 years old</li>
            <li>aged between 19 and 24 years old with either an Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plan provided by their local authority or has been in the care of their local authority</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        You could also consider a levy transfer from another employer to fund an apprenticeship. Transferred funds cover the cost of the whole duration of the apprenticeship.
