        You and the main provider are eligible to receive a payment towards the additional cost associated with training if, at the start of the apprenticeship, the apprentice is:
        <ul class="govuk-body">
            <li>
                Aged between 16 and 18 years old (or 15 years of age if the apprentice’s 16th birthday is between the last Friday of June and 31 August); or
            </li>
            <li>
                Aged between 19 and 24 years old and has either an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan provided by their local authority or has been in the care of their local authority
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        You could be eligible for funding from a levy paying employer which would remove the requirement for you to pay the 5%. Transferred funds cover the cost of the whole duration of the apprenticeship.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Did you know, depending on your industry certain grants could be available to you, for example CITB (Construction Industry Trade Body) pays grants for approved apprenticeships for Level 2 and above. You may also qualify for other grants and funding, please check with your trade, sector body or regional schemes to find out more.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Just a reminder that you have 24 months to use your levy funds once you enter your apprenticeship service account, after this point, your funds will expire.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Just so you know, you're also responsible for paying your apprentice for their normal working hours. You must pay them at least the National Minimum Wage rate depending on their age and the year of apprenticeship training they're in. <br />For more information please visit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employing-an-apprentice/pay-and-conditions-for-apprentices" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">employing an apprentice (opens in a new tab).</a>
