                <p>
                    The headteacher at my school helped me to become an apprentice. I was working as a teaching assistant and wanted to become a fully qualified teacher, so I went to an information evening on different routes into teaching. As a salaried role, I thought this apprenticeship sounded like a great option for me.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-s">A rewarding experience</h4>
                <p>
                    My friends and family have been very supportive of me while I've been completing the apprenticeship. I'm enjoying the day-to-day role because I love working in a great team and teaching the amazing children in our school.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-s">Fast-track your career</h4>
                <p>
                    I think my apprenticeship will open up my future career options by enabling me to start my career in teaching. I hope to be employed as a newly qualified teacher in September.
