                <p>
                    When the opportunity came up for this apprenticeship, I couldn't say no. I work with a lovely team (both human and dog!) and I love that I get to learn and work on projects that I can have an influence over. I still can't get over the fact that I work for the RSPCA, the largest animal welfare charity in the UK!
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-s">Learn from industry leaders</h4>
                <p>
                    Learning whilst working, and getting to apply what I've learnt in real-life scenarios, is a far greater experience to me than going to university lectures and not necessarily getting the appropriate work experience. I learn by doing, rather than just being told about things.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-s">Earn while gaining qualifications</h4>
                <p>
                    This could lead me down an assortment of paths once my apprenticeship is finished. I'm gaining two nationally recognised qualifications in digital marketing, and I will have two years' worth of work experience in the charity sector – working for a hugely influential and recognised charity.
