                    My apprenticeship at Nestle sounded like one of the best opportunities I'd come across. I had no clue what I wanted to do for a job, and I knew that I wanted to do Further Education – but I didn't want to spend three years and lots of money doing a degree that I probably wouldn't end up using. As soon as I saw the advert for my apprenticeship, with a degree included, I just knew it was perfect.

                <h4 class="heading-s">Earn while you learn</h4>
                <p>
                    I'd be working with chocolate and learning skills created hundreds of years ago – with one of the biggest food and drink companies in the world. When I saw that I'd also be working to get a degree, I was over the moon! It seemed to be the best of both worlds – learning relevant skills while also earning a wage.

                <h4 class="heading-s">Develop transferrable skills</h4>
                <p>
                    I am so thankful that I've got a degree – but not just that on its own. I also have three years of invaluable hands-on experience working at Nestle. This experience, and the amount I now know about the confectionery industry, gives me a huge advantage for future career options.
