                    There are loads of benefits to hiring apprentices. Apprenticeships help us to develop knowledge and skills within the organisation, improve employee motivation, provide development opportunities, feed into succession planning – and of course, increase our talent pool!

                <h4 class="heading-s">Tailor your apprentice's training</h4>
                <p>
                    Over the past two years, we've conducted a great deal of research, using Find apprenticeship training and the Institute for Apprenticeship website. To get started, we engage with training providers and meet with potential apprentices and line managers to ensure a shared understanding, making sure the training is right for the individual, role and organisation.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-s">Find the right apprentice</h4>
                <p>
                    To find an apprentice, we recruit internally, put out communications, engage with line managers for recommendations and refer to external sources. We advertise with the training provider, using Recruit an apprentice on the government website.
